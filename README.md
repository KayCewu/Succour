# Succour
A mobile distress application (Panic Button).

Succour is a mobile distress application. The purpose of succour is to enable users to send distress signals to the relevant authorities. How Succour works is, when a user logs in, they click on the relevant authorities that they seek help from. This then sends a message to the relevant authorities notifying them that a user is in distress whilst also sending them the users current geographical location.
